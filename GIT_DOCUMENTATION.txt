=> GIT 1)ALLOW TO STORE DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE SAME PROJECT
        2) ALLOW exchange projects history with your colleges
        3) GIT HAS INTEGRATION SO NO MATER HOW MANY OF YOUR COLLEGES \
            WILL USE THE SAME REPOSITORY FROM GIT
#-pwd=>root(similar to __DIR__)(parent work dirs)
#-ls => list of dirs around me
#-ls -a => shows hidden info
//Global CONFIGURATION:
#git config user.(exp) "(exp)"
# cat => show file's info
//GIT 1)ALLOW TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE GIT ACCOUNT
        2)GIT SETTINGS:1)--SYSTEM = FOR EVERY ONE
                        2)--GLOBAL = FOR USER
                        3)--LOCAL = FOR PRIVATE WORK WITH TEAM
# git (name of command) --global alias.(rename witch u choose) (name of command)
# git status - show the state of files in dir
# git add (file name) will add it to index(Index store list of files)
# chmod (+- exp) (file name)-> modify file
# if above command not work:
    # git update-index --chmod=+x <file name>
    # git show (code that was created after successful git commit command)df3a4fbc
    # git commit --author='name<email>' --date='..'
    # git reset HEAD <dir name>->cancel add command(ignore dirs)
    # git commit -m 'some message to explain' -> write title in file indicated -m arg
    # git add -p(flag give a choice which project add to index) <file name>

//ATOMIC -> TO MODIFY PROJECTS BY ADDING OR FIXING SOMETHING 1
 AND COMMITTING IT-> CORRECT WAY OF GIT(COMMIT MUST BE LOGICAL AND
  BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM PARENT)
  !!!!COMMIT EARLY COMMIT OFTEN!!!!///
